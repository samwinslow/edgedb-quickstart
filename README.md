EdgeDB Quickstart w/ TypeScript, Express.js, and Firebase Auth

Notes:
- EdgeDB introduced object-level access policies in v2, but no sub-object level policies currently exist. Therefore the notion of certain fields only being accessible by certain users is either not possible, or could be done with computed props.
